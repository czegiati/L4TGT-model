# L4TGT-model
TGT stands for TeamGridTactics which used to be my first thesis project. After realizing that it had a poor design, I abandoned the idea. 
This project aims to resurrect the long dead project through distributing it into smaller modules.
(L4 means 'library for')

This module is created to be used as a foundation for later projects using simular game logic. It is not supposed to have any dependencies, making it portable (for example using it in android studio, if I ever decide to do so).

<b>The game built in the following way:</b>
<ul><li>the map is devided to squares</li>
<li>the characters are always bound to a given square</li>
<li>tthe characters can move from a square to any other attached squares</li>
<li>the characters can interract with eachother through the dialog graphs</li>
<li>there are triggers that can be activated, these should be accessed from an external jar file</li>
</ul>
